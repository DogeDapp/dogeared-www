# dogeared-www

[Offline readers](https://guardianproject.info/apps/courier/) are on everyone's mind, [these days](http://amitp.blogspot.com/2014/05/extracting-safaris-reading-list.html). I made my own. It's a plain vanilla HTML+JS+CSS web application that holds hands with an equally vanilla LAMP+API server. It's probably too soon for anyone else to use but it works. Like it works underground on the subway where the Internet still don't shine.

This is pre-alpha version software. It basically works. Until it doesn't. It does not have any documentation to speak of, yet.

No refunds are accepted.
